TODO

Having trouble using webapp2\_extras auth module. Perhaps we're

    WARNING  2013-11-17 09:29:51,441 securecookie.py:77] Invalid cookie signature

The Ferris Framework
--------------------

Ferris is a web framework written in Python for App Engine, inspired by: Ruby on Rails, CakePHP, Django, and Flask. Unlike most other frameworks, Ferris is designed specifically for App Engine.
